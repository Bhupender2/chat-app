Welcome to our Chat App! This project consists of two main components: a client-side application built with React and a server-side application using Socket.io and Express.js.

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: Utilized Socket.IO to enable seamless real-time data transfer between users, allowing instant messaging and updates.
- **Online User Tracking**: Display the number of online users within each chat room in real-time, enhancing user engagement and interaction.
- **Join/Leave Notifications**: Integrated join and leave notifications to notify users when someone joins or leaves a chat room, facilitating communication.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Implemented CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for seamless data sharing and communication across different platforms.

## Folder Structure

- **client**: Contains the front-end React application.
- **server**: Houses the back-end server using Socket.io and Express.js.

## Additional Libraries

- **Cors**: Used CORS to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and enable secure communication between the client and server.
- **Nodemon**: Integrated Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development.
- **React-emoji**: Supports rendering emoji characters in chat messages.
- **React-scroll-to-bottom**: Automatically scrolls to the bottom of the chat window when new messages are received.
